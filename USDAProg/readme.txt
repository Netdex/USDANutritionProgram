Welcome to the USDA Nutrition Database.
In this program, you will be able to search the USDA Nutrition Database, as well as browse it by food group. An additional function is the creation of custom user foods.
There are four buttons on the "home" screen, and you can use the various means to navigate to any individual food's information page, using the top row of two buttons. Searching is self-explanatory, and the "food group" button will lead to a list of food groups, from which you can select a food group, then to an individual food in each group. The bottom two rows have the "add food" and "about" buttons. The "add food" screen allows the user to add their own custom foods into the database, and the "about" panel provides extra information about the creators.
